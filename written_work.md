# Question 2A

With Python, we can use math operators to perform calculations. For example, we can add two numbers together using the `+` operator, or multiply two numbers together using the `*` operator.

Before we try that, let's first try to put it into english how to do this.

#### EXAMPLE: Calcuate and return the volume of a sphere given its radius.

##### The volume of a sphere with radius  ùëü  is  4/3œÄùëü3 . 

    Answer: 
    The volume can be a variable `volume` and the function can return the value of `volume`.
    We can use the math module to get the value of pi.
    The formula is the same thing as 4/3 multiplied by pi multiplied by  the radius to the power of 3
    This can be written as `volume = 4/3 * math.pi * radius ** 3`

 #### Your Turn: Return the total wholesale cost of `copies` copies.
    
 ##### Suppose the cover price of a book is  $24.95 , but bookstores get a  40%  discount. 
 ##### Shipping costs  $3  for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy.
